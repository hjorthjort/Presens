# Inspiration
Getting the right TV recommendations is a harder problem than suggesting products or Facebook friends. Moods change quickly, and what we feel inclined to watch is as much dependent on who we are as what has happened during the day.

# What it does
Presens serves recommendations based on what happens in the world, right now. Apart from looking at user preferences and history, it works with real time data such as current weather and trending topics on Twitter to match your mood, and what is extra relevant in the world today. We present suggestions to you in an easy playlist interface.

# How we built it
We made a custom machine learning algortithm, anlyzing Twitter trends, weather at current location and time of day to genreate the perfect match for you. Using IBM Bluemix and the Alchemy keyword extraction, we scan Twitter for hot words and topics and match it against tv programme descriptions.
